## Week 1 


## I don't weant to create false expectations, so before getting started, you should know...

- This is a **practical course**, namely a workshop, but it is not a lecture or an instructional one-to-one class. 

- You should only be in this course if you are genuinely interested in at least one of the following: 
 - computer science
 - web design
 - entrepreneurship or 
 - information technology.
 
This course expects **problem solvers** and **self learners**.  I will not lecture every time but I will give you the resources and outcomes for each meeting. You are responsible for this work â€” even if you are justified to be absent. 

If you are absent, you will be marked absent (unless medical emergencies or official matters -- **rehearsing, training, tutoring or any other activity during the time assigned for this class will not be justified** --  If you choose to miss class, you are still required to submit the work done for that week. 

This course is an easy "A", but not a free "A". This workshop required you to work, maybe more than any other workshop, and might require you to spend a couple hours at home -- depending on your ability to solve problems (and find reliable information). 

Be prepared to do work more if you are not used to read instructions. For the sake of your own learning, templates are not allowed. Believe me, I know when I see a template, specially if I read the code. 


### Grading 
Grading is simple: 

Assignments are worth 75% of the class. 
- complete assignment - 100
- incomplete (70-80%) - 50
